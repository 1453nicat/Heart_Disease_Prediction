# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Logistic Regression Model Using UCI Heart Disease Dataset

# Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on clinical and demographic features. Using the UCI Heart Disease dataset, we preprocess the data, handle missing values and outliers, encode categorical variables, and train a Logistic Regression model optimized with hyperparameter tuning.

# Results
The optimized Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of approximately **92%** on the test set.
